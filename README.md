# Straw Golem Reborn
This mod adds a helpful (and awfully cute) little golem to do some of your farming for you. It can harvest, replant and deliver crops to a nearby chest. To download, head on over to CurseForge. 
- It's available in both [Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/straw-golem-reborn) and [Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/strawgolem-reborn) editions, each in varying stages of development. 
- This mod, made for Minecraft 1.14+, is a spiritual successor to the [original](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/strawgolem) Straw Golem mod, built for Minecraft 1.12.

| *Straw Golem Reborn!* |

## Getting Started
To create a Straw Golem, stand near the crops or farm where you want it to do its thing. Then place a carved pumpkin on top of a hay bale. (Or carve a pumpkin that is already on a hay bale). After a moment of reflection about the life, the universe, and everything, your little guy will start look for & harvest a full-grown crop.

## Chest Usage
Once a Straw Golem gathers a crop item, it will seek out a chest to store the item. Thus, a chest should be placed near the crops where the golem does its work, and you should make sure the chest have available space inside to hold the soon-to-be harvested crops. 
- Your golem is usually clever enough to locate an available chest on its own. 
- If you have more than one chest in the vicinity, the golem will choose a chest on its own. 

You can also "order" a golem to use a particular chest:
- If using **Fabric**, shift-right-click on the golem with an *empty hand,* then immediately shift-right-click on the desired chest.
- If using **Forge**, do the same thing, except do it while *holding wheat.*

## Lifespan
The Straw Golem has a limited lifespan of 7 in-game days. 
- This lifespan goes down faster when the golem is exposed to the rain or cold, when it stands in water, or when it carries a heavy object, such as a pumpkin. 
- Shivering indicates the prior two conditions, a custom animation the latter.
- Lifespan is restored by feeding the golem wheat, which also heals it. 

As your golem approaches old age, it will begin to to decay, and you will see visual changes to its texture. You may also start to see flies hovering about.

## Hunger
In the **Fabric** edition, the Straw Golem gets hungry over time. 
- When it is hungry, it will sit down, display a cute animation and pout until it is fed.
- Golems are fed using apples. If you are holding an apple, it might beg you for it.

In the **Forge** edition, the golem doesn't exhibit hunger.
- They cannot be fed apples.
- However, they will get excited if you hold an apple, and they'll follow you around while you hold it.

## Miscellaneous
- As already mentioned, there are currently differences between the **Fabric** and **Forge** editions, but we expect these differences to diminish over time.
- The **Fabric** edition has a bonus mod: A Straw Golem may change into a large 'Strawng Golem' if struck by lightning. It functions similarly to an iron golem; these mobs will protect their little relatives from hostile creatures.
- In both editions, you might find it helpful to surround your crops with a fence. This protects the golems from mobs. It also helps to keep them from wandering too far.

## Config
The mod is made to be highly configurable. Users can toggle optional features (lifespan, hunger, etc.), set crops to include/exclude, tweak lifespan & hunger lengths, etc.

## Compatability
The mod has out-of-the-box compat for most modded crops. It also plays nice with many tooltip GUI mods, such as HWYLA, WTHIT, and Jade, so you can see golem health, hunger, and remaining days.
